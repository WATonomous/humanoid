"""Joint position limits for pioneer_bimanual_arm, parsed from the URDF.

The URDF is the single source of truth for joint limits. pioneer_humanoid.bimanual_arm
config imports JOINT_POS_LIMITS from here instead of carrying its own copy (it previously
hardcoded a +/-2pi placeholder that overrode the real limits). Stdlib only -- no
isaaclab, no numpy.

Isaac Sim loads the pre-converted USD under usd/, never the URDF, and nothing
regenerates that USD on a URDF edit. The bridge is pioneer_humanoid.bimanual_arm's
patch_joint_pos_limits_on_prim() (at spawn) and apply_joint_limits() (post-init),
which write these values onto the spawned prims -- keep both call sites.
