        # normally -- the weight jump destabilized exploration from the very start,

        # "RuntimeError: normal expects all elements of std >= 0.0" (a genuine PPO
        # divergence, not a GPU/driver fault). Rolled back to model_7249.pt (the last

        # (6.0, not another full doubling) this time.
        #

        # staying bounded (~0.10-0.13, never exploding) right up to the crash -- so
