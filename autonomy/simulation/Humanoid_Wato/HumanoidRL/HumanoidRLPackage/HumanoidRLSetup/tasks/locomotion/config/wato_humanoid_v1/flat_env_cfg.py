class WatoHumanoidFlatRewards(WatoHumanoidRewards):
    """Kept close to official Isaac Lab G1 flat: no gait-phase clock, no swing-direction
    shaping, no body-spacing constraints. Those custom terms let the policy satisfy reward
    with a stepping *pattern* that produced no net forward displacement (verified: episodes
    with strong phase_* rewards but forward_velocity stuck at exactly 0.0 for 400+ iterations).
    G1's reward set relies on track_lin_vel_xy_exp as the dominant, ungated signal instead.

    A custom double_support_penalty term (curriculum-gated) was carried here for a while
    to break a repeatedly-observed frozen double-support local optimum. Once domain
    randomization was scaled down closer to G1's own (much gentler) reset distribution,
    real stepping emerged naturally without it (reduced_randomization_fresh_002:
    feet_air_time rose 0.0131 -> 0.1364 well before the penalty's curriculum was even
    scheduled to activate) -- removed as unnecessary once that was confirmed live.

    feet_crossing_penalty (anti leg-crossing) now lives in the shared
    WatoHumanoidRewards base class in rough_env_cfg.py, inherited here -- it applies
    to both terrains equally, not just flat."""
